    <p>Hi! I'm Liam, a computer science major. This is my first semester at BYUi and I'm pretty excited!</p>
    <p>I just got home from serving a mission in Tacoma Washington and it was really fun! I learned a lot about the individual discipleship of every member of the church and how much of an important part of the gospel that is.</p>
    <p>I love games of any kind, hiking, drawing, and listening to music! (Rock being my favorite genre... just any kind... maybe not grunge) I have some experience with web design already, but have forgotten most of it. I'm from Boise and Huntington Beach California, my favorite color is green, kinda like old pine tree green yknow? And my favorite food is sushi.</p>
