      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>A website intended to put to use all I've used in this web design class. It's a website that not only shows off the skill I'm obtaining in web design, but also all my other skills and proficencies.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is meant to be a portfolio, one that would be used as a demonstration of work for potential employers. It would be less of a professional resume, and more of a stlye and skill showcase, having a unique, though still respectful style to it.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello! I'm Liam Peterson. I'm a creator who's currently studying at BYUI and majoring in Computer Science, and I love making things. While I played with legos and different coloring things as a kid, my big dive into creation was a robotics competition team in middle school. My team made it to the Vex IQ Worlds Competition, and it's where I especially learned how to code and work with a team. Since then, my mediums have expanded. I did another, more advanced, robotics competition, learning how to machine parts, deal with more mechanical aspects, and learn a more modern programming language. However, that team was cut short by Covid, leaving me with a lot of free time and energy. <br>
        Since then, I've learned game development within the Godot game engine, learned photoshop and pixel art, made a music player in Python script, modded games using CSV files and learned more about that as a whole, 3D printed personal projects and learned how to use Fusion360, and learned website development and design, as shown by this website. In 2023 I started my two year religious mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Tacoma Washington. I was able to learn a lot about myself as a person, how to work with others, and how to work hard. We weren't allowed computers though, so my creative endeavors pivoted to traditional art. Since then, I got home, and began studying computer science! My skills are still growing, and I'm loving making new things. <br>
        Learning things is one of my best attributes. If given a challenge, I'll do my best to learn and overcome it, accomplishing and growing in whatever way is needed of me. I’m able to work well in a team, fulfilling a niche best, but able to work in multiple aspects. I do my best to meet expectations, and face each problem on its own, even if it’s not in the most typical manner. <br>
        However, one of my least favorite things is writing about myself, so why not go see some of my public personal projects! Go to The Showcase to play some of my small games and see my art, or go to the Contact Me page for more information about how to reach me and what I can offer.

      <h3>Showcase</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to The Showcase! This is a small representation of my work, and most things I have released publicly. Keep in mind that I’ve done a lot more projects that were personal and mainly used as a way to learn and develop a new medium and skill that aren’t shown here. But anyways, hope you like what you see, and enjoy!

    Game Jam Games — <br>
    A Game Jam is a small competition put on by someone, designed to be a game dev competition! You’re given a specific theme or item to work around, and are given a very limited amount of time to create a video game. The timeframe for these three Jams were 48-72 hours, a mere 2 or 3 days.<br>
    Two Lane Highway: This game had a timeframe of 48 hours, and the theme was “Two”. I hadn’t had much experience at the time, so it’s a simple arcade game with poor music. It’s a small game, but one I still had fun making, especially in the time given. <br>
    Fresh Field: This game had a song you had to make a game around rather than a theme. It also had a 48 hour timeframe, and I took a much different approach with this one, making it more of a puzzle farming game.<br>
    Robo-Sapien - Learn Freedom: The theme for this one was “Failure is Progress” and we had a 72 hour timeframe. I really pushed myself with this one, delving into aspects I had never dealt with, and I’m pretty proud of the result.

    Art — <br>
    A lot of my digital art is in the form of pixel art. I started with this medium early on to work with my games, and I did a bit of creative drawing too, rather than just video game sprites. Recently, I got into sketching, and even dealt with a few forms of coloring, however, my next big thing is going to be learning digital line art. You can see some of my work on that in the home and contact me pages too! I’m also proficient with photo editing like photoshop to create other visual things.

    Web Design — <br>
    Well, just look at the website you’re on right now! All the assets and design of this website were created by me for a web design course in college. It displays how proficient I am with HTML, CSS, and visual creation.
